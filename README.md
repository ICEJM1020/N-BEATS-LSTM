# N-BEATS-LSTM

Master Project with Informetis Ltd. The data belongs to the company, so it is not publicly available. 

## Introduction

Our project collects the electricity consumption of each of the eight appliances commonly used in households over a two-year period. Based on the data collected, we build a deep learning model for multi-step forecasting. This model is based on the N-BEATS model, an ensemble model based on the calculation of residuals. And our model change the base weak learner as LSTM-based model, which we name it as N-BEATS-LSTM. Compared to our proposed benchmark, our model has a 33\% performance improvement, ranging from 3\% to 30\% improvement compared to other deep learning models. In our experiments, we compared the contribution of various base model components to the overall performance of the model.
